        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          Astrohelion (Astro - heel - eon) is a set of C++ tools that facilitate multi-body trajectory design. Specifically,
          analysis in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) and bi-circular restricted four-body problem (BC4BP)
          is supported.
        </p>

        <h2>Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
          So, what can Astrohelion do? There are several key functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Numerical Integration</strong> Astrohelion leverages the ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers in the GSL 
            library to numerically integrate the equations of motion associated with a few common multi-body astrodynamical systems.
            This propagation is controlled by a <code>SimEngine</code> object that possesses many of the same features as Matlab's
            ODE solvers, such as event detection. The engine creates a trajectory object that can then be operated on for further analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Differential Corrections</strong> Continuous trajectories may be discretized into a series of nodes, and constraints
            can be applied to the nodes, segments between nodes, and the trajectory as a whole. A multiple shooting differential corrections
            algorithm is then applied to the constrained "nodeset" with the goal of satisfying all constraints. The algorithm itself is 
            problem independent and can be applied to CR3BP simulations, BC4BP simulations, or any other type of dynamical problem that is
            included in the Astrohelion system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuation</strong> Once a desirable trajectory has been computed (and possibly corrected to meet certain constraints),
            continuation algorithms can be applied to generate a continuous family of similar solutions. Both natural parameter continuation
            and psuedo-arclength continuation are avaiable, both of which are agnostic to dynamical model.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Export to File</strong> Trajectories are easily saved to file in MATLAB binary format for further analysis or visualization.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          I developed this software in the process of completing my master's degree, and though the tools are fully operational, 
          they are not as flexible and extensible as they could be. My goal is to remedy this situation; if you're a brave soul 
          that wants to try Astrohelion out, please don't be shy about submitting issues and communicating with me about any 
          questions you have.
